# rclipboard: clipboard.js for R/Shiny Applications

### Introduction
[clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) is a super light javascript framework,
which provides copy-to-clipboard functionality using HTML5. The simple `rclipboard`
R package is simple and leverages `clipboard.js` functionality to provide a
reactive copy-to-clipboard UI button component, called `rclipButton`, for
[Shiny](http:// shiny.rstudio.com/) R applications.

### Warning
The rclipButton UI button does not currently work!
